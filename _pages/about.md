Hello, Iâ€™m Junior Cedric! ðŸ‘‹

I am a **PhD student in Natural Language Processing (NLP)** at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ª, supervised by [Dr. Fajri Koto](https://www.fajrikoto.com). My research focuses on a central question:  

**How can we make language models accessible to everyone while ensuring high performance?**

To answer this, I explore ways to improve the **multilingual capabilities** of language models, with a particular interest in:

- **Cultural alignment**:  
  How is cultural knowledge encoded in language models, and how can we adapt these representations to achieve better cultural awareness?

- **Evaluation of language models**:  
  What are effective ways to assess cultural awareness in LMs? Can we develop standardized benchmarks and metrics to evaluate cultural representation, sensitivity, and other capabilities?

- **Cross-lingual generalization and transfer**:  
  Can language models achieve strong reasoning performance in low-resource languages, comparable to English? How can we better transfer such capabilities across languages?

Beyond these core directions, I am also interested in the **applications of NLP in education and finance**.  


Before starting my PhD, I worked as a **Research Associate at MBZUAI**, under the supervision of Dr. Fajri Koto, focusing on the cultural adaptation of large language models. I hold a **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science** (First-Class Honours) from Tunisia ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡³ and a **Masterâ€™s of Science in Mathematics, Vision & Learning (MVA)** from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://www.master-mva.com/) (First-Class Honours) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. During my masterâ€™s studies, I also completed several research internships in NLP and machine learning.
